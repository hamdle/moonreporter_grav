# This game is in development. 

### Development builds available for play testing.

Since this is my first game, I've decided to cut back on the scale of the game in order to finish it. Feature creep is real. The final version of Moon Reporter will be available in June 2018. Now back to chopping features to bring the scope back down to Earth. - Eric - May 16, 2018
